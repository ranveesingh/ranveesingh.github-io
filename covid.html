Use your aligner case to store your aligners when they are not in your mouth and wash your aligner case with soap and water each time you clean your aligners.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>Daily care and maintenance of your Invisalign® aligners. Clean your aligners prior to each insertion. Use a soft bristle toothbrush with water and a small amount of toothpaste. You may find it easiest to clean the outside of your aligners by brushing them while they are still on your teeth, then remove your aligners to clean the inside surfaces.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-2"><span>i)</span><span class="note med-text black-text">Note:</span>Be sure to rinse each aligner thoroughly with water after each cleaning. We also recommend that you use the Invisalign aligner cleaning products once a week, or as needed.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>c) Prior to each insertion and before bed, inspect aligners for cracks and deformation. Severe cracks or deformities should be reported to the doctor immediately. Aligners with cracks the size of the height of the tooth should not be used.</span></h4><h4 class="light-text indent-2"><span>i)</span><span class="note med-text black-text">Note:</span>Parent or guardian should inspect aligners of pediatric patients.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-2"><span>ii)</span>Do NOT use denture cleaning products to clean aligners. Do NOT soak them in mouthwash. Do NOT use bleach-based or other chemical disinfectants as these products can damage the surface of the aligners and may not be safe for use in the mouth.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">2) Is my Invisalign treatment going to be interrupted as a result of practices being closed?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>We understand the concern you have on how this evolving situation may impact your treatment. Even with temporary doctor-office closures, it is unlikely that your treatment will be disrupted. If you have concerns about following your treatment plan for any reason, contact your doctor directly to discuss next steps in your treatment protocol.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>Since each patient and treatment plan are different and customized just for you, check with your doctor on what is best for you. Your doctor may have you wear your current Invisalign aligners for a few weeks longer than originally planned, or choose another option based on your treatment status.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">3) What happens if I lose or damage my aligner during Shelter at Home?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Since each patient and treatment plan are different, check with your doctor on what is best for you. Your doctor may have you wear your current Invisalign aligners for a few weeks longer than originally planned, order a replacement aligner if your aligner is lost or damaged, or choose another option based on your treatment status.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">4) What happens if don’t have my next set of aligners during Shelter at Home?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Since each patient and treatment plan are different, check with your doctor on what is best for you. Your doctor may have you wear your current Invisalign aligners for a few weeks longer than originally planned, order a replacement aligner if your aligner is lost or damaged, or choose another option based on your treatment status.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>If you experience a disruption in treatment for any reason, please contact your treating doctor’s office first for assistance. While non-emergency office visits may not be an option, we have found that many doctors are still very responsive to patient needs, some offices even offer video visits to allow doctors to check on patients’ progress remotely. If you can’t reach your doctor, contact us at<a href="mailto: invisaligncare@aligntech.com">invisaligncare@aligntech.com</a> and we will try to reach your doctor on your behalf.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">5) Can Align ship me a replacement aligner?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Invisalign aligners are medical devices that we ship directly to your doctor as he/she is your treatment provider. If you lose or damage an aligner while dental practices are closed or have any other treatment issues, please contact your doctor to learn about the best options for you.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>While non-emergency office visits may not be an option, we have found that many doctors are still very responsive to patient needs, some offices even offer video visits to allow doctors to check on patients’ progress remotely.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">6) Are aligner shipments to my doctor being delayed?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Align continues to manufacture and ship Invisalign aligners and retainers. Please contact your doctor if you have any questions about your treatment delays.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">7) If I am not able to advance to the next set of aligners and I have to wear my current aligners, how long will my current aligner or retainer last?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Ultimately, only your doctor can advise on aligner wear that is best for your particular case. Your doctor may have you wear your current Invisalign aligners for a few weeks longer than originally planned or if needed, may order a replacement aligner for the stage you are on. Please contact your doctor to learn about the best options for you.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">8) Are you still manufacturing aligners?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Yes, Align continues to manufacture and ship Invisalign aligners and retainers. Fortunately, Invisalign treatment is minimally invasive and most cases should be able to continue according to schedule.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">9) What efforts are Align making to help with the COVID-19 situation?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>We’re glad you asked. At Align, concern for others is core to our purpose of transforming smiles and changing lives, and we are incredibly proud of the work our employees are doing individually to make a difference, as well as the work we are doing as a company.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>We have donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to local hospitals in the communities we operate in, made financial donations to fund medical equipment and relief efforts in Asia, the Americas, and EMEA, and we are working to source and supply additional PPE equipment and medical supply donations for frontline healthcare workers in the communities we serve.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>c)</span>We are also leveraging our 3D printing technology and manufacturing expertise to produce face shields and medical (nasal) swabs for COVID-19 testing kits and donating them to hospitals where we do business.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>d)</span>For more details on our efforts, please visit the COVID-19 page at <a href="index.html">www.aligntech.com</a>.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">10) What if I get a cavity or injure my teeth?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Get in touch with your treating doctor as soon as possible to discuss options. They may advise you to temporarily stop wearing the aligner until your problem has been resolved, or have you continue wearing your current aligner for a little longer. Fortunately, our aligners are easy to remove for treatment.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">11) I forgot to wear my aligners because I’ve been focused on so many other things during this crisis. Will they still fit?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>We understand and hope everything is okay otherwise. If your treatment lapse was short, there’s a good chance your aligners will still fit — though they may fit a little more snugly at first. Please contact your doctor to learn about the best options for you.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>While non-emergency office visits may not be an option, we have found that many doctors are still very responsive to patient needs, some offices even offer video visits to allow doctors to check on patients’ progress remotely.</h4></li><li><h4 class="med-text black-text">12)  How long can I extend wearing aligners?</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>a)</span>Your treating doctor is the best person to advise you on extending aligner wear. It depends on where you are in treatment, how long you’ve been wearing the aligner, and other factors. In some cases, your doctor may have you keep wearing your current aligner longer than usual or may move you forward one stage. Your treating doctor may have other options as well. However, only your doctor can advise you on what’s best for your particular case.</h4><h4 class="light-text indent-1"><span>b)</span>If you experience a disruption in treatment for any reason, please contact your doctor’s office first for assistance.
