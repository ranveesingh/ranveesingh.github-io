Just a few years later in 1999, Align Technology pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the Invisalign® system and soon launched a large U.S national advertising campaign. By 2001, Align had manufactured one million unique clear aligners, helped treat hundreds of patients and trained over ten thousand doctors.</p><p>By combining digital treatment planning and mass-customization, with shape-engineering based on biomechanical principles, we have revolutionized the orthodontic industry. The Invisalign® system has continued to evolve over the last 25 years. Building upon our experience, a database of approximately 16.4 million cases, continuous innovations in aligner materials, software algorithms, 3D force systems, the Invisalign® system can be used to treat a wide range of cases, from teens to adults.</p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p><strong>In 2011,</strong> we acquired the iTero™ intraoral scanner. Digital scanning technology was a natural extension to our digital treatment processes of the Invisalign® system, enabling enhanced patient scans and an improved patient experience. With more than 17 million restorative crown, bridge, and custom implant cases enabled by the iTero scanner to date, Align Technology continues to increase its investment in digital restorative workflows. Today’s practices require a range of digitally enabled solutions – from chairside visualization, prosthetic CAD capabilities, in-office milling options, and laboratory workflows for restorative dentistry, to tools and applications exclusively designed for Invisalign® treatment, which only iTero Element™ can provide.</p><p><strong>Today,</strong> we've helped treat over 17 million patients with the Invisalign® system and are driving the evolution in digital dentistry with the iTero intraoral scanner − helping to modernize today’s practices by enabling enhanced digital orthodontic and restorative workflows to help improve patient outcomes and practice efficiencies.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="main-blurb"><h2 class="blue-header light-text">Align today</h2><h3 class="light-text">Align Technology has continued to evolve significantly over the last 26 years.</h3><div class="row full-row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p>Our goal is to help doctors participate in a new and larger market by investing in innovative products and building brands to drive millions more consumers to their practice.
