As a company and as individual employees, we have dedicated our time, talents, and resources to organizations and programs that make positive differences in the lives of others. Our philanthropic philosophy is to support organizations whose visions tie closely to our own - improving smiles, supporting, and educating youth/teens, and empowering our customers through partnerships with learning institutions and foundations. Globally, we provide opportunities for and actively encourage employees to support local charities through volunteerism, team building, and donation programs. We are extremely proud of our corporate commitment to philanthropic work and are equally proud of the generosity and dedication of our employees. This passion is core to our purpose of transforming smiles and changing lives, and in times of need, how we support our employees, customers, and communities is more important than ever before.   Launched in 2020, the Align Foundation provides a structured means by which significant donations are directed from a donor-advised fund overseen by Fidelity Charitable, with the flexibility to provide smaller monetary donations, processes to donate our products, as well as an organized way to involve our employees in giving activities. Since the donor advised fund inception in 2020, we have granted almost $3 million to non-profits and NGOs around the world.</p><p>Globally, we provide opportunities for and actively encourage employees to support local charities through volunteerism, team building, and donation programs and are extremely proud of our corporate commitment to philanthropic work and are equally proud of the generosity and dedication of our employees.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid margin-small-bot15" src="../img/csr/csr_bike_apac.jpg" /><br /></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid margin-small-bot15" src="../img/csr/UA_humanitarian_aid.png" /><br /></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><img class="img-fluid margin-small-bot15" src="../img/csr/RAQA%20Food%20Sort%202022.jpg" /><p>Our partnership with Benevity, a corporate purpose platform, continues to transform our workplace, culture, and the communities where we live and work.

To help us achieve these commitments, we look to integrate sustainability into our business operations and products in ways that help manage our environmental impact, mitigate risk, reduce costs, and increase stockholder value.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><ul><li>EMS. We have implemented an environmental management system (EMS) at all of our large manufacturing locations. The system is modeled after the ISO 14001:2015 standard and managed by our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) staff.</li><li>Renewable Energy. We have increased investments in onsite photovoltaic solar (PV) systems, with new or enlarged installations at five locations and more scheduled for 2024. We have entered into agreements to procure renewable electricity for portions of our operations, for example, in San Jose, California, the electricity not provided by the onsite PV Systems (grid) is 100% renewable-sourced.  We have also secured renewable energy credits for our Ziyang and Wroclaw factories. The purchase of renewable energy credits for our Ziyang factory reduced the site’s Scope 2 emissions to zero for 2022 and 2023. </li><li>Smart Building. We have brought operations closer to our customers, including the ramp-up of our factory Wroclaw, . Thesite was designed to be sustainability efficient and help reduce the costs and impact of transporting raw materials to our facilities and shipping costs to our customers. The  site along with having a PV System and purchasing renewable energy credits, is also LEED-Gold certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). Our Istanbul. Turkey office, is also certified as a LEED Gold green building. </li><li>Water Conservation. conserve of water is a priority, including outfitting most of our facilities with low-flow toilets and faucet sensors, recycling water for vegetation and grey water use and installing catch basins to collect and use rainwater for operations at our manufacturing location in Juarez, Mexico.  Since 2021 our large sites collectively have reduced the amount of water they consume while increasing the amount being recycled.</li><li>Waste management. We are passionate about minimizing the impact of plastic waste on the environment and we are pleased to share information about Align’s investment in and progress toward minimizing the impact of Invisalign therapy on the environment.</li><li>The Invisalign system is a prescription medical device. Both the medical device and its packaging are regulated by health agencies around the world. Invisalign aligners and their packaging undergo rigorous testing ranging from biocompatibility, bioburden, strength and performance testing. Changes to the device and its packaging must be done in a controlled manner and approved by health agencies around the globe. These changes must not degrade the high quality of the product or its 26-year history of excellent orthodontic outcomes.</li><li>Align has been engaged in activities to minimize our impact on the environment for many years and we are committed to continued progress. We have programs to recycle plastics, reduce product packaging, decrease waste and emissions.. We have also opened new manufacturing facilities that are closer to our customers which helps us decrease carbon emitting activities from shipping products globally.</li><li>Our proprietary aligner material is a multilayer polymer designed to move teeth predictability and consistently using force systems and biomechanics. The material properties add to the complexity of recycling. The polymer or plastic used in our aligners is medical grade plastic, and once the aligners have been worn by patients, they can’t be recycled like household plastic. However, the amount of polymer in the actual aligner is in fact small compared to the amount needed to produce its mold.</li><li>At the production level, the scrap and waste generated by our manufacturing processes does not go into landfill. The production scrap and waste from our facilities in Mexico and Poland is used for energy recovery for third parties. In China, we are repurposing 100% of the production scrap and waste for reuse in floor tiles or general recycling.</li><li>Since 2016, we have reduced the amount of polymer content used in our aligners by almost 50% and reduced the amount of resin used in our aligner molding by 33%. We are focused on continuous improvement and expect to make further reductions over time.</li><li>Reducing the environmental impact of used and unused clear aligners is also a crucial aspect of sustainability and therefore we are continually exploring recycling options as well as ways to properly dispose of plastic waste, ensuring it is correctly sorted and recycled whenever possible.</li><li>In 2020, we began piloting an aligner recycling program with limited number of doctors in the U.S. and Brazil. The aligner recycling program encourages customers and their patients to return used and unused aligners which are recycled in partnership with TerraCycle®, an innovative recycling company that has become a global leader in recycling hard-to-recycle materials. We continue to monitor the program results and participation and are evaluating additional options, including the EMEA and APAC regions.</li><li>Further, we continue to invest significantly in new technologies, materials, and ways of working that can minimize the environmental impact of plastic and/or reduce our carbon footprint. We support innovations in recycling and waste management processes, and we are redesigning our packaging materials to decrease the impact of the materials used in the packaging and shipment of our products.</li><li>Direct Fab, or the ability to 3D-print an aligner directly without a mold, is on the horizon. We believe our digital technology and innovation in 3D printing and “direct fab” will have a significant impact on minimizing scrap and waste from our manufacturing process.</li><li>We are also helping doctors to operate more sustainably by reducing the need for traditional polyvinyl-siloxane (“PVS”) impressions and the mining of the materials used to make those impressions. The use of our iTero™ intraoral scanner, rather than taking a physical impression of a patient’s teeth, removes the need for physical models to be produced, eliminating emissions associated with traditional manufacturing and shipping. As a result, iTero scanners save thousands of metric tons of PVS and plastic in our process.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="white-line"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="light-text">Reducing our environmental impact</h2></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6 text-center"><img class="img-fluid margin-small-bot15" src="../img/environmental-impact.png" /></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p class="under-pic-header">Globally, we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our operations by using energy efficient building designs and controls (e.g. solar panels, motion activated lights, LED lighting, etc.). . We also have programs in place to reduce emissions from employee transportation by providing car charging stations that promote zero or low emissions cars, incentives for carpooling, and organizing company sponsored employee transportation.  In San Jose, California, approximately 1/3 of the workforce in 2023 uses an electric vehicle (EV), taking advantage of the employee benefit of free onsite EV charging.  To-date, the EV Charging program has avoided an estimated 279 metric tons of CO2 emissions.  We have begun the process of eliminating single use plastics in our cafeterias.</p></div><div class="col-12"><br /><p><a href="corporate_social_responsibility/swiss.html">Align Technology Switzerland </a></p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="white-line"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><h2 class="light-text">Responsible Procurement Practices</h2></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><p>Our suppliers are essential to all aspects of our business and our supplier relationships are based on trust and shared commitments to ethical and legal conduct.
